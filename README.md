# Playfair Cipher Tool

This program can encrypt or decrypt user-inputted messages using the Playfair Cipher. It can do so with a randomly generated cipher or a user-inputted custom cipher.

## Background

The Playfair Cipher is an encryption technique introduced by Charles Wheatstone in 1854. It works by first constructing a secret grid of letters. Messages are then split into letter pairs, which are then converted into new letter pairs with the help of the cipher grid.
